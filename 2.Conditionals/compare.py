# In python indentations in a function or wherever needed are very important its like curly braces of c++
def main():
    x = int(input("what is x? "))
    y = int(input("what is y? "))

    # if x>y:
    #     print("x is greater than y")
    # elif x<y:
    #     print("x is smaller than y")

    #     print("x is equal to y")

    # if (x<y) or (x>y):
    #     print("x is not equal to y")

    if x != y:

    # you see in upper we kept on improving the code to compare x vs y who is smaller , here you cannot see that much of improvement but once you make a flowchart you will see the difference. Keep up the good work be hard!!ü¶Åüêé
